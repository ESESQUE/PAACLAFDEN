# Thesis Project: Distributed Machine Learning for IoT-based Networks

This repository contains the code and resources related to my thesis project titled "Distributed Machine Learning for IoT-based Networks". 

## Project Description

This project aims at exploring and improving the field of Distributed Machine Learning (DML) with a specific focus on collaborative learning. It contains several innovative approaches that aim to improve the performance of collaborative learning in environments with constraints on data privacy and observed class imbalance. A comprehensive case study using the PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset is conducted to validate these approaches. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset and the Synthetic Smart Building dataset used for this study.
- `src/`: This directory contains all the source code files for the implementation and evaluation of the proposed approaches.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and performance evaluation.
